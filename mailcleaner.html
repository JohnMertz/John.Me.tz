            <p><span class="headline">I have been the lead (and often only) developer of MailCleaner for about 3.5 years. As of April 12th, 2025, <b>I am no longer an employee of Alinto</b> and the <b>deprecation of MailCleaner support by Alinto has been announced</b>.</span></p><br>
            <p><span class="headline">Please <b>check out the <a href="https://github.com/SpamTagger">new GitHub organization</a></b> that I have set up to continue the legacy of MailCleaner! I have goals to both continue supporting a fork of MailCleaner with minimal changes, as well as to produce a new, lighter-weight hard fork which will be more easily developed into the future.</span></p><br>
            <p><span class="headline">If you would like to contact me directly regarding support for an existing MailCleaner appliance, <b>please email me!</b> I have set up a mailbox address for 'mailcleaner' at this domain.</span>
